# Fintech-Group-Project-01

Summary of interests and intent:

* The kind of data you'd like to work with and the field you're interested in (e.g., trading, quantitative analysis).
    * Trading data for NFT art

* The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data.
    * How is the market growth
    * What is the customer data looking like
    * Popular Chains - Solana NFTs https://solanart.io
    * Who are buying the most?
    https://docs.dune.com

* Possible source for such data.
    * Opeansea, Solana NFTs

This constitutes your Project Proposal and Outline, and it should look something like this:

> Our project is to uncover patterns in NFT project trading sales. We'll examine relationships between types of art and customers; purchase prices and times of day; trends in purchases over the course of the year; and related questions, as the data admits.

## Presentation

After you've analyzed your data to your satisfaction, you'll put together a presentation to show off your work, explain your process, and discuss your conclusions.

This presentation will be delivered as a slideshow, and it should give your classmates and instructional staff an overview of your work. PowerPoint, Keynote, and Google Slides are all acceptable for building slides.

As long as your slides meet the presentation requirements, you are free to structure the presentation however you wish, but students are often successful with the format laid out in the presentation guidelines.
